<h1>GPU computing for statisticians</h1>

Welcome to the Iowa State University Statistics Department's
fall 2013 seminar series on GPU computing for statisticians. Click the "Talks" tab
for the schedule of talks and links to the materials for each talk.
Posted materials include lecture slides and example code for all talks, plus
screencasts of talks that have already been given.<br/><br/>

The purpose of these talks is to teach viewers how to create fast statistical
software using GPU parallelism. Participants will understand basic principles
of parallel computing and learn tools in R, CUDA
C/C++, and Python to help them write GPU-accelerated computer code.
<br/><br/>

At their inception, graphics processing units (GPUs), were mostly used to boost
computer graphics for games. But now,
scientists and statisticians use GPUs to speed up their data analysis
software by orders of magnitude. Become a part of this revolution in
massively parallel computing and come learn how to speed up a variety of
parallelizable computations, from Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
to K-means clustering and beyond.
